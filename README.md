**Author**: [Annette Kalekye](annette.kalekye@student.moringaschool.com)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes data from box office to determine the best direction for production decisions to the new Microsoft studios team, exploratory data analysis is applied to generate insights for the business while presenting three main business recommendations.

### Business Problem

All the big companies are creating original video content and Microsoft wants want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, we are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.Then translate these findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data
I have Used the three movie datasets below, The datasets contain movie ratings, genres, gross earnings, production years and number votes.
In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

imdb.title.basics

imdb.title.ratings

bom.movie_gross


## Methods

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to these recommendations for Microsoft:

- **Informed content startegy:** We have deduced from the data the most popular genres and the ones with the highest ratings. Microsoft should focus on producing movies that align with the audience preferences.

- **Forming strategic partnerships:** In our competition analysis to observe the bigger players in the market we identified companies that are already gaining from movies productions, Microsoft could forge relationships with this high grossing companies to get valuable expertise and a proven success method for movies. Additionally investing in experienced producers and writers in the market will significantly affect the quality and marketability of their productions.

- **Tailored marketing and promotions:** using available resources andplatforms to create awareness of the new product to drive sales, engage audiences and get constant feedback.

- **Diversifying and original content:** While considering succefful genres and themes exploration of opportunities for new content can broaden microsofts audience and gain differentiation from other market players.

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights:

- **Analysis of foreign gross to determine possibility for global penetration:** This modeling could use already available data, such as breed and intake condition however he data was not enough to cunduct the analysis.

- **Geographical data availability:** This data could predict where marketing efforts can be doubled up on, what markets to focus on and advice on customers preferences by location, we lacked this data in our dataset.
